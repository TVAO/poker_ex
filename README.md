# PokerEx

PokerEx is a basic Texas Hold 'Em system implemented in Elixir that takes
advantage of the Phoenix Framework and Phoenix Channel module to deliver
real-time features. 

The system has a dependency on the Elixir Registry module which requires 
Elixir 1.4.0 or later, as well as a dependency on Erlang's :gen_statem 
module which will require Erlang 19.1 or later to work properly.
